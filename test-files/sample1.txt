This is an example text file for testing the MCP keyword search server.
The word example appears multiple times in this document.
We can search for various keywords like: server, testing, search, and more.

Example with a capital E at the beginning.
Another EXAMPLE in all caps.
The example keyword is case-insensitive by default.

Here are some technical terms:
- MCP stands for Model Context Protocol
- Server architecture and implementation
- Keyword matching algorithms
- File system operations

This file contains enough content to test:
1. Multiple matches on the same line: example example example
2. Matches across different lines
3. Case sensitivity testing
4. Special characters and punctuation: example! example? example.

The search functionality should return:
- Line numbers where matches are found
- The actual line content
- Position indices of each match
- Total count of all matches

Testing edge cases:
- Empty lines

- Lines with only whitespace
- Very long lines with multiple keyword occurrences: The example shows that example matching works when example appears multiple times.

End of test file with one more example.
